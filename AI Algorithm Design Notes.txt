Algorithm for AI:

Ideal: < 50 defensive stat + > 50 opposing offensive stat + affinity = weakness
If you find that ideal, stop looking and use that attack alone. Otherwise experiment.
Find the defensive stats. If you don't know the defensive stats, then use attacks and look at the damage.
	In reality, the program already knows the damage because it can read the move object. We're
	just simulating the unknown here. Instead of performing calculations, we'll allow it to read the move
	object after it has entered a situation that would allow it to calculate based on the prexisting formula.

Value of a move is determined by:

(Offensive Stat - Guess Defensive Stat)*Elemental Affinity Modifier*Guess Elemental Weakness Modifier+Investigate Mod

Offensive Stat: ATT or MATT of AI
Guess Defensive Stat: Guess at DEF or MDEF of the human. 0 if we don't yet know. Otherwise, actual value.
Elemental Affinity Modifier: 1.5 if the attack is the AI's elemental affinity.
Guess Elemental Weakness: Guess at elemental weakness of the human. Always x1 if we don't know.
	We should have a table here to where the AI can guess the weakness.
Investigate Mod: We will have a modifier of some sort to make certain moves higher on an execution priority list.
	It should be an arbitrarily high number so the AI can't ignore it and doesn't just get stuck using their
	hypothetically best attack repeatedly.
